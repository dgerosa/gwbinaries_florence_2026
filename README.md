# PhDschool_Florence_2026

## Aims

This is a PhD-level class on **"Gravitational waves from compact binaries"** of about 10 hours. I cover the principles of gravitational-wave propagation and emission, from the linearized Einstein equation, to the quadrupole formula. This formalism is then applied to the specific case of binary black holes, including their dynamics on eccentric orbits and gravitational-wave propagation on cosmological backgrounds. I then cover the theory behind gravitational-wave detectors with laser interferometers, including basics of matched filtering, parameter estimation, and population analyses.


### Florence 2026

This is material for a PhD class I'm teaching at the PhD school *Theoretical Aspects of Astroparticle Physics, Cosmology and Gravitation*, taking place at the Galileo Galilei Institute for Theoretical Physics in Florence in March 2026.

### Prerequisites

This class assumes students have already seen and understood (well, that's a big word!) General Relativity at the graduate level, including general knowledge of tensor and vector calculus.
I mostly follow Maggiore's 


Course Outline:
Part I: Christopher Moore (lectures 1-3)
The first module will give an overview of some of the mathematical background to general relativity: manifolds, the metric, tensors, covariant derivatives, the Riemannian curvature. We will then cover the linearised Einstein field equations and the Schwarzschild solution.

Part II: Davide Gerosa (lectures 4-6)
This module covers the basics of gravitational wave emission and propagation: linearization of the Einstein field equations, their Newtonian limit, and the gravitational-wave quadrupole formula. We then apply this formalism to the specific case of binary black holes and highlight their astrophysical relevance.
