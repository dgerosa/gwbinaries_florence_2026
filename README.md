# Gravitational waves from compact binaries

## Aims

This is a PhD-level class on **"Gravitational waves from compact binaries"** of about 15 hours. We cover the principles of gravitational-wave propagation and emission, from the linearized Einstein equations to the quadrupole formula. This formalism is then applied to the specific case of binary black holes, including their dynamics on eccentric orbits and gravitational-wave propagation on cosmological backgrounds. We then cover the theory behind gravitational-wave detectors with laser interferometers, including basics of matched filtering. 

## Florence 2026

We prepared this material for a PhD course we're teaching at the PhD school *Theoretical Aspects of Astroparticle Physics, Cosmology and Gravitation*, which will take place at the Galileo Galilei Institute for Theoretical Physics in Florence in March 2026. Lectures by Davide Gerosa, example classes by Caroline Owen.

## Prerequisites

This class assumes students have already seen and understood (well, that's a big word!) General Relativity at the graduate level, including general knowledge of tensor and vector calculus.

I mostly follow Maggiore's textbook (*"[Gravitational waves, Volume 1: theory and experiments](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/gravitational-waves-9780198570745?q=maggiore&lang=en&cc=it)"*). Indeed, numbering of sections and equations in Davide's notes refer to Maggiore's book.
